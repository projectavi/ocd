constants.js has important URIs and info to be imported elsewhere
-----------------------------------------------------------------
import contract address from oldDeploy, in the variable "degreeAddress"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
deploy the contract on remix, you are now york university and the contract is your certificate
------------------------------------------------------------------
when using safemint on remix, use the metadata URI that is in constants.js and obviously the address you are minting to, which is the student's address
